# Census data analysis: ACS and SAIPE

By [Christine Zhang](mailto:czhang@baltsun.com)

An analysis of data from the 2013-17 American Community Survey (ACS) and the Small Area Income Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program for a December 7, 2018 Baltimore Sun story titled ["What new Census data reveal about wealth, diversity, and connectivity in Maryland"](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-acs-census-release-20181206-story.html).

The code used to produce the analysis is saved in a series of six notebooks.

Each notebook corresponds to a topic in the story. For example, [`04_broadband_acs.ipynb`](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/baltimore-sun-data/census-data-analysis-2018/blob/master/04_broadband_acs.ipynb) refers to the findings under the section referring to broadband connectivity, "Maryland rates well nationally for broadband connectivity, but Baltimore and the state's western- and southern-most counties lag."

We used [`tidycensus`](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html) by Kyle Walker and [`censusapi`](https://hrecht.github.io/censusapi/index.html) by Hannah Recht to access the Census Bureau API in `R`.
